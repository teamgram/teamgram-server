# Security policy

This document describes how to report vulnerabilities, supported versions, and disclosure. The root [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) is a short entry.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

- **Do not** disclose unfixed security issues in public issues.
- Report privately, e.g. via Telegram to the project [author](https://t.me/benqi) (see README Notes), or via any contact method later listed in SECURITY.md.

## Supported versions

- Security updates apply to the **currently maintained** major version (see releases/tags and CHANGELOG).
- EOL versions do not receive security patches; upgrade to a supported version.

## Disclosure

- After a fix is **released**, the issue may be summarized in CHANGELOG or a public issue (without exposing exploit details before the fix).
- Reporters can ask to be credited in the release notes.
