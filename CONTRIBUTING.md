# Contributing to Teamgram Server

Thank you for your interest in contributing. Please read the full guidelines before submitting changes.

## Quick links

- **Full contributing guide**: [specs/contributing.md](specs/contributing.md) — branch strategy, PR rules, code style, commit messages, and how to build/run tests locally.
- **Project specs index**: [specs/README.md](specs/README.md) — architecture, protocol, dependencies, security, release, and roadmap.

## Summary

1. Work on a branch (do not push directly to the default branch).
2. Open a Pull Request with a clear title; link related issues if any.
3. Ensure code is formatted with `gofmt` and passes `go test ./...` (and any CI checks once enabled).
4. Follow the commit message conventions described in [specs/contributing.md](specs/contributing.md).

For security issues, do **not** open a public issue; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [specs/security.md](specs/security.md).
